# AI Virtual Mouse & Interactive Gesture Ecosystem 🚀

An advanced, multi-modal human-computer interaction (HCI) suite that translates **Computer Vision hand tracking**, **smartphone motion sensors**, and **voice commands** into real-time operating system control, interactive 3D simulations, and gamified browser servers.

Developed by **[Vishal P](https://github.com/vishalpatil133-cmd)** *(11th Grade Student Developer & ECE Enthusiast)*.

## 📽️ Project Overview
This project is a compilation of 4 futuristic utilities that bridge the gap between humans and machines without requiring expensive hardware:

1. **AI Webcam Virtual Mouse** (`virtual_mouse.py`): Control your cursor, click, scroll, draw in mid-air, and dictate voice text using a standard webcam.
2. **Smartphone Wi-Fi Air Mouse** (`wifi_mouse.py`): Turn your mobile phone's gyroscope/accelerometer into an air mouse and multi-touch trackpad over local Wi-Fi.
3. **Cyberpunk Neon Racer** (`car_server.py`): Control a browser-based 3D car simulation using two-hand virtual steering wheel gestures.
4. **Stark 3D Holographic HUD** (`stark_server.py`): Manipulate a 3D wireframe Arc Reactor using zoom/pan gestures, including 4-way projection mirroring for holographic plastic pyramids.

## 🌟 Key Features & Engineering Highlights

### ⚡ 1. Knuckle-Mapped Stable Click Tracking
Most hand-tracking systems map the cursor to the **index finger tip** (`Landmark 8`). However, when you curl your index finger to click/pinch, the tip slides downward, causing the cursor to drift away from the target button.
* **Our Solution**: We mapped cursor tracking to the **Index Finger MCP (Base Knuckle)** (`Landmark 5`). Because the base knuckle remains completely still during finger curls, clicks are **100% stable** and have zero cursor drift!

### 🏎️ 2. Butter-Smooth 30 FPS Performance
* Optimized the MediaPipe Hand pipeline to run at a solid 30 FPS.
* Lowered `model_complexity` to `0` and restricted tracking to `max_num_hands=1` in mouse mode. This completely eliminated CPU thermal throttling on consumer laptops.
* Integrated dynamic LERP (Linear Interpolation) smoothing to make cursor movement feel soft and fluid.

### 📌 3. Global Window Hotkeys
Need your webcam preview window to stay visible while playing games or working in Photoshop?
* **`Ctrl + Alt + A`**: Sets the Camera Feed window to **Always on Top** (Topmost). Includes a high-pitched audio beep.
* **`Ctrl + Alt + V`**: Reverts the window to normal. Includes a low-pitched audio beep.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Pre-requisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui numpy websockets keyboard
```
*(Note: Run your terminal as Administrator on Windows to enable the `keyboard` library global hotkeys).*

### 2. Running the Utilities

#### 🖱️ Module A: Webcam Virtual Mouse
```bash
python virtual_mouse.py
```
* **Performance Mode**: Press `H` to hide landmarks and overlay graphics, saving CPU rendering overhead.
* **Always-on-Top hotkey**: Press `Ctrl+Alt+A` to keep the feed visible over other apps.

#### 📱 Module B: Smartphone Wi-Fi Controller
```bash
python wifi_mouse.py
```
* Note the IP address printed in the console (e.g., `http://192.168.1.5:8000`).
* Open this URL in your phone's browser (Safari/Chrome) while connected to the same Wi-Fi. Turn on your mobile rotation lock to use the air gyroscope!

#### 🏎️ Module C: Virtual Steering Racer
```bash
python car_server.py
```
* Open `http://localhost:8002` in your PC browser.
* Hold a virtual steering wheel in front of your camera. Tilt to steer! Pinch right hand to accelerate, left hand to brake.

#### ⚛️ Module D: Stark Hologram HUD
```bash
python stark_server.py
```
* Open `http://localhost:8001` in your PC browser.
* Pan with one hand, zoom with two hands, and double pinch to overcharge the arc reactor. Press `H` in the browser to toggle the 4-way holographic projector mode.
